          The main goal was to make a new product in 1 month. There have never been such tight deadlines. I will say in advance, using my communication and research skills, I successfully completed the task, even having time to master new technologies and discover new skills.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-[20px]">
          When we were given this task, it was a shock for the whole company, the task affected not only us, but the whole company. We managed to become best friends with POs and developers by coordinating our every step together.

        <p className="text-xl mb-[20px]">
          My immersive approach helped the team understand that this feature is much more complex and larger than originally envisioned. In the process of designing and writing code, I played the role of the custodian of knowledge. I also participated in QA testing of all builds of iOS and web applications.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          After the release, I wrote documentation about how the function works, what is the main logic and limitations. I hope these documentation help someone in the future.
